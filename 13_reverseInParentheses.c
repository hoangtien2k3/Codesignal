/*
    Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.
    Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.

    Ex:
    + For inputString = "(bar)", the output should be
    solution(inputString) = "rab";
    + For inputString = "foo(bar)baz", the output should be
    solution(inputString) = "foorabbaz";
    + For inputString = "foo(bar)baz(blim)", the output should be
    solution(inputString) = "foorabbazmilb";
    + For inputString = "foo(bar(baz))blim", the output should be
    solution(inputString) = "foobazrabblim".
    Because "foo(bar(baz))blim" becomes "foo(barzab)blim" and then "foobazrabblim"
